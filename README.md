# Edge-Detection-Motion-Sensing-with-OpenCV-on-Raspberry-Pi
<h2>Overview:</h2>

This project is about Edge Detection & Motion Sensing with OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 4.
In Image Processing and Computer Vision, Edge Detection and Motion Sensing are vital techniques. Edge detection refines visual data by highlighting features, while motion sensing interprets movement by analyzing image sequences. Both improve understanding of visual data.

In this project, we will use OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi 4 to process video frames. To detect edges, we will apply the Canny edge detection method on grayscale versions of the frames. To detect motion, we will calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between consecutive grayscale frames, where a significant change in MSE indicates motion. This setup provides a real-time visual representation of edges and potential motion in the video feed.
